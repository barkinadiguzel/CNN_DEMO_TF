# CNN_DEMO_TF
A clean and minimal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) demo built using TensorFlow + Keras. It uses dummy data to show the core structure of a CNN — convolution, pooling, and dense layers — without needing a real dataset. Perfect for understanding the basics or comparing frameworks like PyTorch.
